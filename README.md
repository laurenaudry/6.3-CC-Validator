# To Do
- [x] Start with copying over the boilerplate for react
- [] Write the structure first
 - [x] Should render a basic credit card layout
 - [x] Only need to match one card type for this mode
- [] Work on presentation second
 - [] If any input (number, date, cvv, and name) is not valid then the border of said input should be red
 - [x] Name must be at least 8 characters in length to be valid
 - [] If some, but not all, of the fields are filled out, the card should have a red border.
- [] Play with validations of inputs and regex (think about the input tag's pattern attribute)
